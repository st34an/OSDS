Open Source Distributed Search

The Open Source Distributed Search Project should deliver a fast and effective distributed way of searching the Internet. 
With Tools like node.js, hbase and hadoop for example it should work totally different than Google. 
The idea is to share searching across users and let users be both client and nodes at the same time. 
A basic principle of Big-Data computation is to "bring computation to the data and not data to the computation". 
I hope to find many contributors who are really committed to this so that we could bring up a smooth solution that even could be an alternative to Google.
